[Dear Friend, I want to tell you story
Most
terribly
cold
it
was
;
it
snowed
,
and
was
nearly
quite
dark
,
and
evening
—
the
last
evening
of
the
year
.
In
this
cold
and
darkness
there
went
along
the
street
a
poor
little
girl
,
bareheaded
,
and
with
naked
feet
.
When
she
left
home
she
had
slippers
on
,
it
is
true
;
but
what
was
the
good
of
that
?
They
were
very
large
slippers
,
which
her
mother
had
hitherto
worn
;
so
large
were
they
;
and
the
poor
little
thing
lost
them
as
she
scuffled
away
across
the
street
,
because
of
two
carriages
that
rolled
by
dreadfully
fast
.
3
One
slipper
was
nowhere
to
be
found
;
the
other
had
been
laid
hold
of
by
an
urchin
,
and
off
he
ran
with
it
;
he
thought
it
would
do
capitally
for
a
cradle
when
he
some
day
or
other
should
have
children
himself
.
So
the
little
maiden
walked
on
with
her
tiny
naked
feet
,
that
were
quite
red
and
blue
from
cold
.
She
carried
a
quantity
of
matches
in
an
old
apron
,
and
she
held
a
bundle
of
them
in
her
hand
.
Nobody
had
bought
anything
of
her
the
whole
livelong
day
;
no
one
had
given
her
a
single
farthing
.

She
crept
along
trembling
with
cold
and
hunger
—
a
very
picture
of
sorrow
,
the
poor
little
thing
!
5
The
flakes
of
snow
covered
her
long
fair
hair
,
which
fell
in
beautiful
curls
around
her
neck
;
but
of
that
,
of
course
,
she
never
once
now
thought
.
From
all
the
windows
the
candles
were
gleaming
,
and
it
smelt
so
deliciously
of
roast
goose
,
for
you
know
it
was
New
Year
’
s
Eve
;
yes
,
of
that
she
thought
.
6
In
a
corner
formed
by
two
houses
,
of
which
one
advanced
more
than
the
other
,
she
seated
herself
down
and
cowered
together
.
7
Her
little
feet
she
had
drawn
close
up
to
her
,
but
she
grew
colder
and
colder
,
and
to
go
home
she
did
not
venture
,
for
she
had
not
sold
any
matches
and
could
not
bring
a
farthing
of
money
:
from
her
